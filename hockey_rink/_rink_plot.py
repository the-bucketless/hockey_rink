            dy: array-like (optional)
                The length of the arrow in the y direction.
                One of dy and y2 has to be specified.

            x2: array-like (optional)

                The endpoint of the arrow.
                One of dy and y2 has to be specified.

            ax: matplotlib Axes (optional)
                If not provided, will use the currently active Axes.

            clip_to_boards: bool (default=True)
                Whether or not to clip the plot to stay within the bounds of the boards.

            update_display_range: bool (default=False)
                Whether or not to update the display range for plotted objects outside of the rink.

                The display range will be updated to the extremity of the passed in coordinates. If, for example, scatter
                points are outside the rink, half of the outermost point may be cut off.

                Adding Text will automatically update the display range, regardless of what is set here.

            plot_range: {"full", "half", "offense", "defense", "ozone", "dzone"} (optional)
                Restricts the portion of the rink that can be plotted to beyond just the boards.

                Only affects x-coordinates and can be used in conjunction with ylim, but will be superceded by
                xlim if provided.

                "full": The entire length of the rink.
                "half" or "offense": The offensive half (largest x-coordinates) of the rink.

                "ozone": The offensive zone (blue line to end boards).
                "dzone": The defensive zone (end boards to blue line).

                Note that plot_range only affects what portion is plotted. Coordinates outside the range can still
                impact what is shown.

            plot_xlim: float or (float, float) (optional)
                The range of x-coordinates to include in the plot.
                    float: the lower bound of the x-coordinates. The upper bound will be the boards.
                    (float, float): The lower and upper bounds of the x-coordinates.

                Note that plot_xlim only affects what portion is plotted. Coordinates outside the range can still
                impact what is shown.

            plot_ylim: float or (float, float) (optional)
                The range of y-coordinates to include in the plot.
                    float: the lower bound of the y-coordinates. The upper bound will be the boards.

            skip_draw: bool (default=False)
                If the rink has not already been drawn, setting to True will prevent the rink from being drawn.

            draw_kw: dict (optional)
                If the rink has not already been drawn, keyword arguments to pass to the draw method.

            use_rink_coordinates: bool (default=True)
                Whether or not the plotted features are using the rink's coordinates. If, eg, adding text relative the
                size of the figure instead, this should be set to False.
