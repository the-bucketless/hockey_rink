        Note that there may be functions for which this won't work/be appropriate. Also, all parameters passed to the
        plotting function are keyword only.

        Arguments:
            fn: a matplotlib or seaborn plotting function

            clip_to_boards: bool (default=True)
                Whether to clip the plot to stay within the bounds of the boards.

            update_display_range: bool (default=False)
                Whether to update the display range for plotted objects outside the rink.

                The display range will be updated to the extremity of the passed in coordinates. If, for example,
                scatter points are outside the rink, half of the outermost point may be cut off.

                Adding Text will automatically update the display range, regardless of what is set here.

            plot_range: {"full", "half", "offense", "defense", "ozone", "dzone"} (optional)
                Restricts the portion of the rink that can be plotted to beyond just the boards.

                Can be used in conjunction with plot_ylim. When used without plot_ylim, the y-coordinates will be the
                entire width of the ice. Will be superseded by plot_xlim if provided.

                "full": The entire length of the rink.
                "half" or "offense": The offensive half (largest x-coordinates) of the rink.
                "defense": The defensive half (smallest x-coordinates).
                "ozone": The offensive zone (blue line to end boards).
                "dzone": The defensive zone (end boards to blue line).

                Note that plot_range only affects what portion is plotted. Coordinates outside the range can still
                impact what is shown.

            plot_xlim: float or (float, float) (optional)
                The range of x-coordinates to include in the plot.
                    float: the lower bound of the x-coordinates. The upper bound will be the boards.
                    (float, float): The lower and upper bounds of the x-coordinates.

                Note that plot_xlim only affects what portion is plotted. Coordinates outside the range can still
                impact what is shown.

            plot_ylim: float or (float, float) (optional)
                The range of y-coordinates to include in the plot.
                    float: the lower bound of the y-coordinates. The upper bound will be the boards.
                    (float, float): The lower and upper bounds of the y-coordinates.

                Note that plot_ylim only affects what portion is plotted. Coordinates outside the range can still
                impact what is shown.

            skip_draw: bool (default=False)
                If the rink has not already been drawn, setting to True will prevent the rink from being drawn.

            draw_kw: dict (optional)
                If the rink has not already been drawn, keyword arguments to pass to the draw method.

            use_rink_coordinates: bool (default=True)
                Whether the plotted features are using the rink's coordinates. If, eg, adding text relative the
                size of the figure instead, this should be set to False.

            nbins: int or (int, int) (optional)
                The number of bins in plots requiring binned statistics (eg heatmap, contour).

                The first int will be the number of bins used in the x direction and the second in the y. If only one
                value provided, it will be used for both.

                Will be ignored if binsize is not None.

            binsize: float or (float, float) (optional)
                The size of bins in plots requiring binned statistics (eg heatmap, contour).

                The first float will be the size of the bins in the x direction and the second in the y. If only one
                value provided, it will be used for both.

                If the binsize does not evenly divide the plotting region, the excess space is removed equally from
                the first and last bins.

            reduce_fn: str or callable (default np.mean)
                The function to use on binned statistics.

                The following are available str options:
                    "mean"
                    "sum"
                    "count"
                    "std"
                    "median"
                    "min"
                    "max"

                If None, will default to count.

            fill_value: float (default=np.nan)
                The value used in plots requiring binned statistics when no values are present in a coordinate bin.

            as_center_bin: bool (default=False)
                Whether to use the center of bins for plots requiring binned statistics rather than the
                endpoints. Used in contour plots but not heatmaps.

            zorder: float (default=20)
                Determines which rink features the plot will draw over.

            position_args: list (optional)
                Parameters that can't be passed to matplotlib functions as keywords.
                For example, ax.plot(x=x, y=y) will result in an error. To avoid this, set position_args to ["x", "y"].

                If the binsize does not evenly divide the plotting region, the excess space is removed equally from
