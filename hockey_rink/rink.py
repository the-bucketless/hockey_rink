    Allows for customization to support any number of different possible rink dimensions.

    Default coordinate system and feature dimensions correspond to those used by the NHL.
        ie) All lengths are measured in feet.
            x-coordinates go from -100 to 100 and y-coordinates from -42.5 to 42.5.

            The actual coordinates won't be affected.  The purpose is to update the coordinates passed in to
            align with the drawing, not to alter the drawing to align with the coordinates.

        y_shift: float
            Amount y-coordinates are to be shifted.

            When viewing the rink horizontally, the coordinate of the center of the ice surface from bottom to top.
                eg) If using data with a coordinate system that goes from 0 to 85, y_shift should be 42.5.

        The features parameters allows for both updating default features and creating new features.

            dzone
            red_line

        Updates to existing features and new features both expect a dict with key/value pairs corresponding to
        RinkFeature attributes. Additionally, features expect a key for the feature_class with a value indicating the
        type of RinkFeature class being used.

            eg)
                feature_name = {
                    "feature_class": feature_class,
                    "x": feature_x,
                    "y": feature_y
                    "length": feature_length,
                    "width": feature_width,
                    "thickness": feature_thickness,
                    "radius": feature_radius,
                    "resolution": feature_resolution,
                    "reflect_x": feature_reflect_x,
                    "reflect_y": feature_reflect_y
                    "visible": feature_visible,
                    "rotation": feature_rotation,
                    "clip_xy": feature_clip_xy,
                    ...
                }
        Explanations for the attributes can be found in the RinkFeature documentation.

        Some exceptions are:
            Multiple x and y coordinates can be passed as an array_like value. If multiple values are provided,
            one feature will be created for each combination of coordinates.

            x and y values for faceoff lines correspond to the nearest faceoff dot. Each coordinate will be
            included in four L shapes (above and right, below and left, etc) with the shape being altered
            accordingly. The exact coordinate is determined by the values passed to x_dot_to_lines and y_dot_to_lines.

            clip_xy also accepts a boolean value and defaults to True for all features.
                When True, the boards will be used as the clip path.
                When False, no clip path is used.

        Other attributes can be provided so long as they can be used by matplotlib's Polygon (such as color or zorder)
        or are appropriate for that particular feature (eg RinkImage accepts an image_path attribute).

        All parameters that expect a dict only require any desired changes to be included in the key/value pairs.
            ie) To update the length of the boards (and, thereby, the rink), all that needs to be passed in is:
                boards={"length": new_length}
        Including other attributes in the dict is unnecessary unless they too require updates.

        Any parameters not included will be supplied with defaults based on this rink type, though they may be affected
        by changes to other parameters.

        To remove a feature from the rink, set visible to False.
            eg) trapezoid={"visible": False}

        New features can be included by passing in a dict with a name not included in the default list.
            eg) new_feature={"class": feature_class, ...}

        The default zorders are:
            1: nzone, ozone, dzone
            2: crease
            5: goal_line, trapezoid, ref_circle, center_circle, faceoff_circle,
                faceoff_dot, faceoff_lines, crease_outline, net
            6: crossbar
            10: red_line, blue_line
            100: boards

        Parameters:
            rotation: float (default=0)
                Degree to rotate the rink.

            x_shift: float; default: 0
                Amount x-coordinates are to be shifted.

                When viewing the rink horizontally, the coordinate of the center of the ice surface from left to right.
                    eg) If using data with a coordinate system that goes from 0 to 200, x_shift should be 100.

                The actual coordinates won't be affected.  The purpose is to update the coordinates passed in to
                align with the drawing, not to alter the drawing to align with the coordinates.

            y_shift: float; default: 0
                Amount y-coordinates are to be shifted.

                When viewing the rink horizontally, the coordinate of the center of the ice surface from bottom to top.
                    eg) If using data with a coordinate system that goes from 0 to 85, y_shift should be 42.5.

                The actual coordinates won't be affected.  The purpose is to update the coordinates passed in to
                align with the drawing, not to alter the drawing to align with the coordinates.

            alpha: float; default: None
                The alpha blending value, between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque).

                If not None, will be used for all features of the rink that don't override it.

            line_thickness: float; default: 1/6
                Thickness of all the thin lines on the ice (eg the goal line and faceoff circles) if not
                otherwise updated.

            line_color: color; default: "red"
                Color of all the thin lines on the ice (eg the goal line and faceoff circles) if not
                otherwise updated.

                An example of how to specify colors can be found at the following link:
                    https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colors.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-colors-colors-py

            line_zorder: float; default: 5
                The zorder of all thin lines on the ice (eg the goal line and faceoff circles) if not
                otherwise updated.

                Determines which features are drawn first (lower values will cause features to appear under
                other features they may overlap).

            x_dot_to_lines: float; default: 2
                Length-wise distance between a faceoff dot and the L shapes in the faceoff circle.

            y_dot_to_lines: float; default: 9/12
                Width-wise distance between a faceoff dot and the L shapes in the faceoff circle.

            goal_line_to_dot: float (default=20 except for IIHFRink which is 22)
                Distance between the goal line and the faceoff dots.

            boards: dict; optional
                Attributes to update for the boards.

                Also affects the constraint that prevents features from extending outside the boards.

            features: dict (optional)
                Updates to default features and new features to be added, as described above.
